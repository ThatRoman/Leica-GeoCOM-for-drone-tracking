[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

[Python documentation convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0258/)

### Documentation

The documentation generation is automated using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
The scripts generating the documentation for ```track.py``` and ```GeoCom.py``` are available in the folder ```scripts\documentation```.  
To generate it on a Windows system : see ```scripts\documentation\make.bat```.  
To generate it on a Unix system:

* Open a terminal
* Go into the ```scripts```folder
* Type ```make html``` to generate it in HTML
* Type ```make latexpdf``` to generate a PDF

Further information is available in ```scripts\documentation\Makefile```.

To change the directory of the source files of the project where Sphinx looks up for comments (in this case the directory of ```track.py```and ```GeoCom.py```), go in ```scripts\documentation\conf.py``` and set ```sys.path``` to the directory of your choice.

## Installation
### Requirements
* Windows 10
* Leica cable GEV267 for Total station TCRP1203
* Leica cable GEV269 for Total station MS50, MS60
* Total station with GeoCom support (TCRP1203, MS50, MS60)
* [Python2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
* pip package manager for Python 2.7 (normally already included in Python installation)
* [pyserial](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial/2.7)
    *  Install with ```C\:Python27\python.exe -m pip install pyserial ``` in the command line
* USB cable drivers for GEV267,GEV268,GEV269 V3.0 available on Leica MyWorld website or on the "/util/" folder of this repository
    * Install the driver :
        * Download the driver and extract it
        * Plug-in the cable on the Windows computer
        * Go to "Device Manager"
        * Find the device "FT232R"
        * Right click and select "Update Driver"
        * Browse your computer into the extracted folder
        * Select the folder "Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2,Vista, 7, 8"
        * Click on next to finish the installation
    * After this process, it's possible you need to redo this with the new device showed in the list called "Serial USB Converter"

## Run and Usage
### Run
```
$ C:\Python27\python.exe track.py
-d (verbose for debug)
-b (big prism -- default = mini-prism)
-p "port" (ex: "COM1" -- This can be found in "Device Manager" on Windows)

```
### Usage
Use ```-h``` to show usage
```
  Options:
  -h,           --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT,      --port=PORT       specify used port [default: /dev/ttyUSB0]
  -b BAUDRATE,  --baudrate=BAUDRATE
                                  specify used baudrate [default: "COM3"]
  -d, --debug                     show debug information
  -B, --Big                       use 360 big prism
```
